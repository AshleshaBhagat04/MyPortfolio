# Ashlesha Search – Portfolio Website
Welcome to my personal portfolio! This interactive search-based website showcases a curated selection of my projects in Software Engineering and AI/ML, wrapped in an intuitive and modern UI.
A modern, responsive recreation of the Google homepage built with my touch.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
Other Tools: Figma, Cursor
Libraries/Concepts Used:
- DOM manipulation
- Modal UI
- Tag-based filtering
- Responsive Flex/Grid Layouts


## Inspiration
This project represents my journey as both a builder and a researcher, where UX, SWE and AI collide in thoughtful, often unconventional ways. From reimagining the familiar “Ctrl+Z” through human-centered algorithm design to developing accessible no-code AI platforms, every tile reflects an experiment, a hypothesis, or a quiet breakthrough. Along the way, I explored new tools and workflows to stretch my own comfort zone—including moments where I leaned on Cursor for certain features and implementations, both as a test of adaptability and as a means to prototype more fluidly.
